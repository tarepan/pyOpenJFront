------------

The latest release is availabe on pypi. You can install it by:

Workaround for ``ValueError: numpy.ndarray size changed, may indicate binary incompatibility``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This type of errors comes from the Numpys' ABI breaking changes. If you see ``ValueError: numpy.ndarray size changed, may indicate binary incompatibility. Expected 96 from C header, got 88 from PyObject`` or similar, please make sure to install numpy first, and then install pyopenjtalk by:

.. code::

   pip install pyopenjtalk --no-build-isolation

or:

.. code::

   pip install git+https://github.com/r9y9/pyopenjtalk --no-build-isolation

The option ``--no-build-isolation`` tells pip not to create a build environment, so the pre-installed numpy is used to build the packge. Hense there should be no Numpy's ABI issues.
