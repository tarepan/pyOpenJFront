pyopenjtalk
===========

The functional interface for text processing and waveform synthesis.

.. note::

    For ease of use, all the functional interfaces use global instances of :class:`pyopenjtalk.openjtalk.OpenJTalk` internally.

    If you want to get a full control (e.g., using an external dictionary), please manually instanciate and use these classes.
