### Grapheme-to-phoeneme (G2P)

```py
In [1]: import pyopenjtalk

In [2]: pyopenjtalk.g2p("こんにちは")
Out[2]: 'k o N n i ch i w a'

In [3]: pyopenjtalk.g2p("こんにちは", kana=True)
Out[3]: 'コンニチワ'
```

### Create/Apply user dictionary

1. Create a CSV file (e.g. `user.csv`) and write custom words like below:

```csv
ＧＮＵ,,,1,名詞,一般,*,*,*,*,ＧＮＵ,グヌー,グヌー,2/3,*
```

2. Call `mecab_dict_index` to compile the CSV file.

```python
In [1]: import pyopenjtalk

In [2]: pyopenjtalk.mecab_dict_index("user.csv", "user.dic")
reading user.csv ... 1
emitting double-array: 100% |###########################################|

done!
```

3. Call `update_global_jtalk_with_user_dict` to apply the user dictionary.

```python
In [3]: pyopenjtalk.g2p("GNU")
Out[3]: 'j i i e n u y u u'

In [4]: pyopenjtalk.update_global_jtalk_with_user_dict("user.dic")

In [5]: pyopenjtalk.g2p("GNU")
Out[5]: 'g u n u u'
```

### About `run_marine` option

After v0.3.0, the `run_marine` option has been available for estimating the Japanese accent with the DNN-based method (see [marine](https://github.com/6gsn/marine)). If you want to use the feature, please install pyopenjtalk as below;

```shell
pip install pyopenjtalk[marine]
```

And then, you can use the option as the following examples;

```python
In [1]: import pyopenjtalk

In [2]: label = pyopenjtalk.extract_fullcontext("こんにちは", run_marine=True) # for text processing frontend only
```
